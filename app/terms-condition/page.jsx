            As Association for Craft Producers (ACP) is a non-governmental
            organization, ACP does not have an exporting license as per Nepal
            Government Rule. Hence, ACP established a sister company: Nepali
            Craft Trading Pvt. Ltd. (NCT). All export activities are taken care
            by NCT. NCT will deal directly with the international
            partners/buyers to process orders or any other export concerns.
          </p>
          <p>
            NCT works closely with international buyers to meet their shipping
            needs. Be it by air, land, and/or sea, they have strong working
            relationships with preferred shipping companies and can offer low
            negotiated rates. They can also accommodate to work with a buyers'
            preferred shipping company, as well as coordinate with the shipping
            schedule of products from other companies.
