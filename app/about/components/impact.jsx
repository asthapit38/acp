        The Impact
      </p>
      <p className="font-light leading-loose">
        ACP has transformed the lives of artisans, mainly women from a position
        of powerlessness to empowerment, from vulnerability to a higher level of
        economic security. The women have become more confident and have been
        able to command greater degree of respect from their family and society.
        Some of the producers have moved ahead and started their own production
        units. They have been role models and source of inspiration in their
        community. ACP has made significant contribution over the years to the
        national economy through employment generation and poverty alleviation.
        ACP has contributed to the upliftment of the handicraft industry. ACP
        has succeeded in changing the notion that women-oriented crafts like
        weaving, knitting, sewing, embroidery are only for hobbies. ACP has
        proven that unorganized women work force with farm and family
        responsibilities, working irregular hours can be organized and turned
        into competent and reliable work force. ACP has played a vital role in
        reviving the traditional art and skills which were on the verge of
        extinction such as weaving, block printing, hand-hammered copperware,
        felting through design innovation, technical upgradation and marketing.
        ACPâ€™s flagship store, Dhukuti has a strong brand presence for more than
        35 years.
