          From the inception, ACP adhered to values of fairness and long-term
          sustainability. At the core of the operations is the economic
          empowerment, social development and capacity building of low-income
          artisans that would improve the quality of lives. ACP adopted the
          alternative way of doing business that put people before profit which
          was termed as Fair Trade. ACP is one of the pioneers of Fair Trade in
          Nepal and is also the founder Chair of Fair Trade Group (FTG) Nepal,
          the national network of Fair Trade. ACP is actively involved in
          advocating and promoting Fair Trade. It strictly adheres to the Fair
          Trade principles.{" "}
