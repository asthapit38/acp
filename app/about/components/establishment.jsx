          Ms. Meera Bhattarai founded ACP to socially and economically empower
          low-income artisans primarily women. Often, craft producers of Nepal
          come from economically and socially deprived backgrounds. They lacked
          say in the family which usually stemmed from the fact that they were
          not contributing to the overall money basket of the family. Although
          the women possessed basic skills, neither were their skills or
          products adequately recognized nor did they receive moral and
          technical support. They were largely ignorant of raw material quality,
          efficiency, costing, marketing, consumer tastes and preferences. They
          lacked the capital required for their handwork. There was an immediate
          need to address the vulnerability of women craft artisans to promote
          their socio-economic status. Ms. Bhattarai realized that mere training
          was not sufficient. There was a need of an organization that would
          provide integrated support to the craft workers as well as be
          self-sufficient. As a result, ACP was founded.

            “When women have money, they have a say in the family – and their
            voice is heard. She gains confidence and respect. That’s in real
            sense Economic Empowerment.”
